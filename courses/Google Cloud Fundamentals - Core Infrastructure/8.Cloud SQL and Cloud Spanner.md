A moment ago, I discussed NoSQL databases. Now, let's turn our attention to relational database services. Remember, these services use a database schema to help your application keep your data consistent and correct. Another feature of relational database services that helps with the same goal - transactions. Your application can designate a group of database changes as all or nothing. Either they all get made, or none do. Without database transactions, your online bank wouldn't be able to offer you the ability to move money from one account to another. What if, after subtracting $10,000 from one of your accounts, some glitch prevented it from adding that 10,000 to the destination account? Your bank would have just misplaced $10,000.

Classically, relational databases are a lot of work to set up, maintain, manage, and administer. If that doesn't sound like a good use of your time but you still want the protections of a relational database, consider Cloud SQL. It offers you your choice of the MySQL or PostgreSQL database engines as a fully managed service. Cloud SQL offers both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases that are capable of handling terabytes of storage. As of this recording, Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL is in beta. So, check the website for details of its status. Of course, you could always run your own database server inside a Compute Engine virtual machine, which a lot of GCP customers do. But there are some benefits of using the Cloud SQL managed service instead. First, Cloud SQL provides several replica services like read, failover, and external replicas. This means that if an outage occurs, Cloud SQL can replicate data between multiple zones with automatic failover. Cloud SQL also helps you backup your data with either on-demand or scheduled backups. It can also scale both vertically by changing the machine type, and horizontally via read replicas. From a security perspective, Cloud SQL instances include network firewalls, and customer data is encrypted when on Google's internal networks, and when stored in database tables, temporary files, and backups.

Another benefit of Cloud SQL instances, is they are accessible by other GCP services and even external services. You can authorize Compute Engine instances for access Cloud SQL instances and configure the Cloud SQL instance to be in the same zone as your virtual machine. Cloud SQL also supports other applications and tools that you might be used to, like SQL WorkBench, Toad, and other external applications using standard MySQL drivers. If Cloud SQL does not fit your requirements because you need horizontal scaleability, consider using Cloud Spanner. It offers transactional consistency at a global scale, schemas, SQL, and automatic synchronous replication for high availability. And, it can provide petabytes of capacity. Consider using Cloud Spanner if you have outgrown any relational database, or sharding your databases for throughput high performance, need transactional consistency, global data and strong consistency, or just want to consolidate your database. Natural use cases include, financial applications, and inventory applications.
